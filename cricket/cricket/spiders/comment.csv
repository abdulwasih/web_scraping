19.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Karthik, <b>SIX</b>, <b>DK! He has done it. And he outdoes MSD! In staying cool.</b> The Indians are piling on him. Let him breathe lads. There's kisses, cuddling, hugs and what not for DK. Look at Soumya Sarkar, he is in tears and is inconsolable. A couple of Bangladeshis in the dugout are in tears as well. <b>DK has won the Nidahas Trophy single-handedly</b>. How cool was DK though! A flat six over extra cover. Skimmed over the rope. Just. But this game is about margins. Inches will do. Soumya Sarkar who had done really well till then, suddenly lost the plot and served up an overpitched delivery outside off, DK crashed that lofted drive and <b>this shot will be etched in every Indian's memory - maybe on par with MSD's loft off Kulasekara on that magical Mumbai night on 2nd April 2011</b>. That gave India the World Cup. This Sri Lanka's Independence Trophy. Unbelievable end to a near unbelievable game. What more can I say?</p>"
19.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, <b>out</b> Caught by Mehidy Hasan!! My word. I'm out of words actually. Rebound taken by long-off. What a moment in the game. Lofted the slower delivery straight up, both the fielders almost collided, there was a slight contact between the two, where the shoulders brushed, that's why the catch popped out - but Mehidy who was nearby hung on. A wicket and a dot - but it is DK who is on strike next ball - some consolation for India. <b>Vijay Shankar c Mehidy Hasan b Soumya Sarkar 17(19) [4s-3]</b></p>"
19.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, <b>FOUR</b>, Vijay Shankar gets four. India needed that. Very full around off, Vijay Shankar opens the face of the bat at the last moment and directs it between backward point and short third. It rolls away to the fence. This is getting unbearable now</p>"
19.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Karthik, 1 run, yorker length on off, dug out to sweeper cover, superb ball</p>"
19.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, 1 run, driven hard to extra cover, <b>direct hit and Vijay Shankar would've been out.</b> There's a ricochet off the bowler's hand, Vijay Shankar sends Karthik back, who wanted two</p>"
19.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, no run, half-volley outside off, the right length to hit it for six, but Vijay Shankar is under extreme pressure, swings and misses. They can't take a bye as well. Dot and the pressure on the youngster</p>"
19.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, <b>wide</b>, <b>had Rahim hit, Vijay Shankar would've been out</b>. But called wide. Rightly so. Low full-toss slipping down leg, Vijay Shankar didn't get a tickle. This is manic</p>"
18.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Karthik, <b>FOUR</b>, amazing from DK. What batting. Under pressure. With his place not assured when some of the big guns return. But he has the nerve tonight. <b>Is he Steve Waugh in disguise?</b> Shuffles across and almost sits under this delivery to scoop it over short fine's head. Almost a six, one bounce over the ropes. Rubel who has bowled so well in the tournament, has gone for 22 in the penultimate over</p>"
18.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Karthik, 2 runs, Karthik comes down the track and flat-bats the length delivery wide of Rubel, Vijay Shankar races to the other end, they make it across for two. DK on strike and that's what India want</p>"
18.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Karthik, no run, Rahim appeals for a caught behind, then calms down. Slower delivery outside off, Karthik cuts and misses, wanted to hit it too hard, missed. Good change up from Rubel</p>"
18.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Karthik, <b>SIX</b>, he is playing the innings of his life. Six over deep mid now. The Indians are going mental as do the Sri Lankans. The dugout is up and clapping. What drama. What tension. Length ball angling in, on middle, slogged with power and timing into the deep mid fence, just sat back and didn't hold back. Just six, but will do</p>"
18.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Karthik, <b>FOUR</b>, the crowd have got their voice back. This was tailing in late, but Karthik somehow slugged it after having got under it, long-on was beaten by the pace and bounce off the deck, it just skipped past his right-hand, goes away for four. DK has 10 off 2</p>"
18.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Karthik, <b>SIX</b>, DK! What a blow. First ball and he has launched it for a biggie. Low full-toss, low backlift from Karthik as Rubel missed the yorker, incredible power from DK to lift it flat over long-on's head. The start India needed</p>"
17.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, <b>out</b> Caught by Sabbir Rahman!! Slogged and caught at long-on. Right off the toe end of the bat. Slower delivery on off, Manish Pandey was waiting on the back foot to launch, he hasn't found his timing at all tonight. Holes out. <b>Just a legbye and the wicket off the over</b>. Incredible stuff from the Fizz. <b>Manish Pandey c Sabbir Rahman b Mustafizur 28(27) [4s-3]</b></p>"
17.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, leg byes, 1 run, quick short of length delivery, Vijay Shankar got inside the line to help it, off the thigh pad and the ball just rolls wide of the stumps. They take a legbye</p>"
17.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, no run, <b>wow. Wow. What bowling from Mustafizur.</b> Vijay Shankar thumps the bat hard into the pad. He clearly is under pressure. Action replay of the previous delivery. Nothing going right for the youngster, he drives and misses</p>"
17.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, no run, superb bowling. Three dots in a row. Vijay Shankar made it difficult for himself by shuffling across, Mustafizur just followed him with an off-pace delivery, going across, Vijay Shankar drives and misses. Looks at the umpire for a wide, but his movement costs him</p>"
17.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, no run, beaten again. Beautiful bowling. Another cutter, again angling it across Vijay Shankar, who clearly doesn't seem to pick it out of the hand. This is shorter than the previous delivery. Manish Pandey at the other end is itching to get the strike</p>"
17.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, no run, Mustafizur angles one across Vijay Shankar and beats him. Good start by Bangladesh. The cutter doing the trick, pitches and goes past the slog</p>"
16.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Manish Pandey, no run, has Manish Pandey got in? Yes he has. <b>Third ump again</b> into the action. Driven back to the bowler, who shied back at Manish Pandey's end, <b>just got the bat down in the nick of time.</b> More importantly it is a dot as far as Bangladesh are concerned</p>"
16.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, 1 run, <b>had Soumya Sarkar's flick hit, Vijay Shankar would've been gone.</b> Manic action all around. Yorker dug out to the right of Soumya Sarkar, who does exceptionally well to get across, slide and then attempt the flick even as Vijay Shankar had given up</p>"
16.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, <b>FOUR</b>, Vijay Shankar finds the gap, wide of the diving deep mid. Soumya Sarkar after aiming at the blockhole all over, goes for the slower delivery, it is outside off and the right length to slog, Shankar gets a crucial boundary</p>"
16.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Manish Pandey, 1 run, very full on off, smashed straight to the fielder at long-on. Couldn't get under that</p>"
16.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Manish Pandey, 2 runs, yorker length on off, dug out to sweeper cover and Manish Pandey's long reach enables him to make it. The throw was a bit wide of Rahim, he had to get the ball back to the stumps, that's the reason Pandey made it in. He is panting after getting there. <b>Third ump was called for and he made the decision</b></p>"
16.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, 1 run, full on off, lofted with no great timing, bounces through to long-off</p>"
15.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, no run, Mustafizur comes back superbly. A slower delivery outside off, Manish Pandey slogs to leg and misses. Rahim thinks there's an edge, but the ball missed the bat</p>"
15.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, <b>FOUR</b>, Manish Pandey gets the four. Low full-toss outside off, Manish sliced it wide and over backward point's head. Splits third man and sweeper cover to perfection. Deft touch as well, reached out to play and connected well</p>"
15.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, leg byes, 1 run, well bowled Fizz. Dug the shortish delivery into the pitch, but took the pace off it, Vijay Shankar was through the pull way too early. Completely done in, off the body and they take a legbye</p>"
15.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Vijay Shankar, no run, off-cutter, no pace, slanted across Vijay Shankar, who drives and misses. He wanted to go over cover, but didn't connect</p>"
15.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, 1 run, slanted across Manish Pandey, on a length, he biffs it to long-on</p>"
15.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, 2 runs, slashed to deep backward point, it bounced in front of Nazmul and that made it a difficult stop. On top of that he was under pressure by the screaming of Rahim, they take two and the keeper shows his displeasure known to the left-arm spinner by shouting. He wanted just one out of that</p>"
14.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, no run, good finish. Yorker at the base of off, dug out. Well bowled</p>"
14.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Manish Pandey, 1 run, slower delivery, off-cutter, Manish Pandey gets a thick edge to short third</p>"
14.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Manish Pandey, <b>FOUR</b>, gets four more. This over is proving to be costly. Down the track and slugs the length ball hard and straight down the ground, too much timing and power on the shot, long-on gets across but the ball beats him</p>"
14.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Manish Pandey, <b>FOUR</b>, another boundary. But it has come off a thick outside edge, Manish Pandey and India won't mind, flies over short third's head. Manish threw everything at the full and wide delivery outside off</p>"
14.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Vijay Shankar, 1 run, another slower delivery, sits up for Vijay Shankar, who pulls to deep backward square leg, but just a single</p>"
14.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Soumya Sarkar to Manish Pandey, 1 run, slower delivery on the pads, glanced to short fine, Vijay Shankar rushes to the other end to complete the single</p>"
13.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Vijay Shankar, no run, very full on off, dug out to cover</p>"
13.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Vijay Shankar, <b>FOUR</b>, Vijay Shankar breaks the shackles and releases the pressure valve with a boundary. Sweep-pull to a length delivery on middle, right in between deep square and deep mid. Much needed for the Indians</p>"
13.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Manish Pandey, 1 run, tossed up on the stumps, Manish Pandey makes room and lofts this off the middle of the bat, but straight to the fielder at long-off, on the bounce</p>"
13.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Vijay Shankar, 1 run, Vijay Shankar is off the mark with a back foot punch to long-on</p>"
13.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, <b>out</b> Caught by Mahmudullah!! Is that the game? Is that the Nidahas Trophy? Could well be. Cacophony out there - the Bangladeshis going wild, shouting, screaming with <b>Nazmul Islam doing the ""Naagin dance""</b>. They feel Rohit is the big fish. The pressure was building and Rohit had to go for the big hit. Got under a full ball, but didn't have the room to free his arms, sliced it straight to the fielder at long-on. Easy for Mahmudullah. Pressure catch but he never looked like dropping it. <b>Rohit c Mahmudullah b Nazmul Islam 56(42) [4s-4 6s-3]</b></p>"
13.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Manish Pandey, 1 run, tossed up and Manish Pandey on the charge drives to long-on</p>"
12.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, 1 run, Liton Das and he misses from extra cover. Even the very quick Manish Pandey wouldn't have made it. He punched this to the fielder, good bounce as well, <b>but no direct hit and Pandey will survive</b></p>"
12.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, no run, another mistimed hit. Cutting short ball, into the pitch, Manish Pandey drags it to short fine off the bottom edge</p>"
12.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, 1 run, short of length on off, punched to the left of extra-cover for a run</p>"
12.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Manish Pandey, 1 run, Manish Pandey hasn't found his timing as yet. Is lucky that he miscued this, on the bounce to long-on</p>"
12.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, 1 run, good bowling by Mustafizur, followed Rohit as he gave him the charge, punched to sweeper cover</p>"
12.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, 2 runs, slower delivery from round the wicket, on off, Rohit drives in the air, but wide of extra cover. Long-off prevents the boundary</p>"
11.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit comes down the track and smashes this right through Nazmul Islam's hands, who took some pace off the shot, that would've stung him for sure, keeps it to a single</p>"
11.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, no run, very full, in the blockhole, dug out to cover</p>"
11.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Manish Pandey, 1 run, fired in outside off, Manish Pandey lofts to long-off, bounces to the fielder</p>"
11.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, 1 run, full on the pads, on-driven to long-on</p>"
11.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Manish Pandey, 1 run, uses his feet does Manish Pandey, the bat flows through the line as he finds long-off</p>"
11.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, 1 run, <b>50 for Rohit</b>. Just a raise of the bat and back to work. On the back foot and works it through mid-wicket</p>"
10.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Manish Pandey, no run, make that four! And what an over it has been. Dragged it down, flat outside off, Manish Pandey went for too much power on the cut, off the thick inside edge and to the fielder at mid-wicket</p>"
10.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Manish Pandey, no run, bit quicker, on middle, turned straight to the fielder at mid-wicket</p>"
10.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Manish Pandey, no run, slows it up and pulls the length back, Manish Pandey on the charge can only find Shakib</p>"
10.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Manish Pandey, no run, nicely tossed up on off, Manish Pandey gets forward and pushes it watchfully to cover</p>"
10.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, cuts late and to the right of backward point, easy single</p>"
10.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Manish Pandey, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Manish Pandey gets forward and drives to sweeper cover for a single</p>"
9.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Manish Pandey, 1 run, back of a length on the hips, nudged to deep square leg, they wanted two initially but settle for one as the fielder gets in quickly from the deep</p>"
9.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Manish Pandey, no run, fuller than a good length, at good pace, Manish Pandey defends half-forward to cover</p>"
9.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Manish Pandey, no run, skiddy short of length delivery outside off, Manish Pandey mistimes the pull to mid-on. Hurried onto the bat</p>"
9.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rahul, <b>out</b> Caught by Sabbir Rahman!! Short ball does it for Rubel and he is pumped. Rahul cannot control the pull as the bounce gets big on him and the top edge lands safely at deep square leg in one of Bangladesh's safest fielders' hands. <b>Rahul c Sabbir Rahman b Rubel 24(14) [4s-2 6s-1]</b></p>"
9.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, short of length on off, Rohit steers it to the right of backward point. The run counter is ticked along</p>"
9.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rahul, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabbed down to third man</p>"
8.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rahul, 1 run, keeps the strike with a single to long-on. Played off the back foot as the length was short</p>"
8.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rahul, <b>wide</b>, Rahul is disappointed that he has missed out. Fired down leg, he cannot lay bat on the paddle</p>"
8.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rahul, <b>FOUR</b>, superb use of the crease. Not short, just a smidgen, if you can be ultra-critical, but Rahul was on the back foot in a flash, cut it late and beat two men - backward point to his right and sweeper easily to his left</p>"
8.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, 1 run, reads it off the pitch, bunts it to long-on off the back foot</p>"
8.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rahul, 1 run, right in between cover running back and sweeper coming in. KL survives. He charged the bowler and was beaten in flight, he too like Dhawan tries to go across the line, <b>the leading edge falls safely</b></p>"
8.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, 1 run, full on off, wristed to long-on</p>"
8.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, no run, tossed up on middle, forward and pushed to short cover</p>"
7.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, shortish outside off, Rohit slashes hard and in the air, wide of backward point, third man gets the body behind the ball and keeps the duo to just one</p>"
7.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rohit, no run, lazy waft from Rohit. Length delivery outside off, he wanted to deflect it to third man. Missed. So easily could've edged it</p>"
7.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rahul, 1 run, <b>Mehidy again and he misses!</b> From backward point even as Rohit had given up. Pushed off the front foot to the right of Mehidy who did really well to come up with the ball as he got up, had time to line it up, but misses. <b>Huge huge moment in the game</b></p>"
7.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rahul, 2 runs, nice back foot punch with an open bat face, wide of the diving backward point fielder, third man gets across to cut off the boundary, Rahul used the depth of the crease to good effect there</p>"
7.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, misfield from Liton Das at cover and that won't please the bowler. Straightforward stop and he fumbles to let Rohit get off strike</p>"
7.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rohit, no run, went for the attempted yorker, turned out to be a low full-toss, clipped to mid-wicket inside the ring. Swung in the air</p>"
6.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, shortish on off, Rohit easily punches it to long-on</p>"
6.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, no run, that gripped off the pitch, nearly squared Rohit up on the back foot, but didn't turn square to cause problems, Rohit defends to backward point</p>"
6.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, 2 runs, floated up outside off, too much air, attempting to lure Rohit into the big hit, instead the Mumbaikar square-drives with elan behind backward point for two more. Hit all along the ground</p>"
6.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rahul, 1 run, uses his feet and gets a thick inside edge on the forward defence, but short fine is deep, so they take a single</p>"
6.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rahul, <b>SIX</b>, too short, second time that Shakib has gone for a six against the short ball, Rahul rocks back and thumps a flat six over deep mid. That skimmed over the fielder's head</p>"
6.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, slower and shortish outside off, Rohit punches off the back foot to long-on</p>"
5.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, 1 run, short of length into the hips, turned through mid-wicket for a run</p>"
5.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, no run, another free-flowing drive but finds cover. Such timing from Rohit</p>"
5.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, 2 runs, leans and drives this overpitched delivery outside off gloriously through the covers. Easy two by the time sweeper gets across</p>"
5.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, no run, direct hit from the sub Ariful Haque would've been interesting? No. The throw is well wide and Rohit dives back in. He dabbed this to the left of short third, wanted a quick single but Rahul sent him back in time</p>"
5.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rohit, <b>FOUR</b>, finesse. We saw that from Mahmudullah earlier on, this shot is even better. More classier. Width outside off, Rohit opens the face of the bat and steers it right between backward point and short third. Mehidy dived but to no avail</p>"
5.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mustafizur to Rahul, 1 run, short of length and angling in from round the wicket, Rahul defends with soft hands in front of backward point, Rohit gets across for the quick single</p>"
4.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, no run, sliding down, nudged behind square</p>"
4.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, no run, tossed up outside off, driven straight to the fielder at extra-cover</p>"
4.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, <b>SIX</b>, that is big. Nazmul Islam watches the ball fly over long-off. Stayed back, launched the tossed up delivery on off for a big six. Remember these aren't small boundaries here at the Premadasa</p>"
4.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, <b>FOUR</b>, one ball from Nazmul Islam is enough for Rohit even as the crowd chant his name. Even the Sri Lankans rooting for him. Not a surprise. Coming back to the shot, he used his feet and then made room slightly to open his body up, ensured he got it over mid-off inside the ring</p>"
4.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rohit, no run, hint of turn, from a fuller length, Rohit defends watchfully to backward point</p>"
4.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Nazmul Islam to Rahul, 1 run, uses his feet, gets too close to the pitch of the ball, but squeezes it out to mid-on. Quick single completed</p>"
3.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rahul, 1 run, short of length and angling in, worked away through mid-wicket, there was confusion between the duo, but no harm done in the end</p>"
3.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rahul, <b>FOUR</b>, Rahul is off the mark in superb fashion. Sees the short and wide delivery outside off, carves it off the back foot, a slashing cut and nearly all the way, one bounce over the ropes at sweeper cover. Too much width and KL latched on</p>"
3.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Rahul, no run, pacy short of length delivery on off, calmly defended back down the track. Bang on the money is Rubel</p>"
3.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Raina, <b>out</b> Caught by Rahim!! Rahim is confident, so confident that he has taken the review. Called a wide. But he convinces Shakib and they take it. <b>Looks to be a bottom edge</b>. UltraEdge confirms the same. Raina goes for a blob. Big wicket. Full marks to Rahim for spotting the tiny edge. Raina looked to flamingo-pull that, with one leg off the ground but could only feather a snick behind. Rahim dived to his right to grab that and when the umpire didn't give it out, was perplexed. Bangladesh hit back with two quick wickets. <b>Raina c Rahim b Rubel 0(3)</b></p>"
3.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Raina, no run, beaten for pace. Right through Raina as he advanced and swung, Rubel followed Raina and the ball goes past the inside edge</p>"
3.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Rubel to Raina, no run, short of length on the pads, Raina tucks it to mid-wicket</p>"
2.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, no run, tossed up outside off, driven straight to the fielder at extra-cover. Didn't hit the gap</p>"
2.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, no run, short and wide outside off, Rohit cuts straight to the fielder at cover-point, there's a fumble, runs, but sent back in time by Raina</p>"
2.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Dhawan, <b>out</b> Caught by (sub)A Haque!! Leading edge and taken. Bangladesh needed that. Beaten in flight was Dhawan as he advanced, but decided to go through the shot, problem was he was looking to go across the line, leading edge is smartly held at mid-off by the sub running to his right and tumbling to take it. <b>Dhawan c (sub)A Haque b Shakib 10(7) [6s-1]</b></p>"
2.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, sliding on, into the pads, worked away behind square</p>"
2.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Dhawan, 1 run, wrists it to mid-on to take the single</p>"
2.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Dhawan, <b>SIX</b>, now Dhawan gets into the act. Rank long hop, Dhawan murders the pull off the back foot, was waiting for it on the back foot and over deep square leg, India off to a flier</p>"
1.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mehidy Hasan to Rohit, no run, faster and sliding straight on, pushed back watchfully to the bowler</p>"
1.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mehidy Hasan to Rohit, <b>SIX</b>, that is a monster. Rohit is in the mood today. Just the look on his face says it all. He is determined as ever. Uses his feet and lofts the tossed up delivery over wide long-on. The bowler and the fielders could just see the trajectory of the ball as it sailed over their heads</p>"
1.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mehidy Hasan to Rohit, <b>FOUR</b>, predictably the length is shortened, Rohit is an experienced campaigner, sits back and pulls hard and wide of the diving backward square fielder inside the ring. 10 off 2</p>"
1.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mehidy Hasan to Rohit, <b>SIX</b>, tonked over cow corner. Sees the flight on that, doesn't hold back, biffs it with all power and off she goes</p>"
1.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mehidy Hasan to Dhawan, 1 run, good bowling. Dhawan had to adjust his shot, wide of the crease and angled in, Dhawan was looking for the sweep, but it skidded on, Dhawan works it in front of him and off they go</p>"
1.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Mehidy Hasan to Dhawan, no run, tossed up from round the wicket, on off, Dhawan pushes it to cover-point and wants a quick single, nothing doing from Rohit</p>"
0.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, no run, fired in full, around off, driven straight to the fielder at extra-cover</p>"
0.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Dhawan, 1 run, brilliant running between the wickets from both batsmen, Dhawan used his feet and nudged it to short fine, Rohit was backing up a long way and made it easily</p>"
0.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, hurries off the pitch, Rohit works it off the back foot through mid-wicket</p>"
0.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, <b>FOUR</b>, Rohit is off the mark in grand style. Down the track and lofts cleanly over mid-on. Got to the pitch and didn't hold back</p>"
0.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Rohit, no run, slower and tossed up on off, Rohit's feet didn't move as he stood beside the line of the ball, inside edge onto the pad and it dribbles away</p>"
0.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Shakib to Dhawan, 1 run, Rahim shouts encouraging words to Shakib as Dhawan flicks uppishly from middle through mid-wicket. May have been the seam-up ball first up for it swung in</p>"
19.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mehidy Hasan, 2 runs, again down the track, but the length is shorter, Mehidy Hasan slaps it wide of Vijay Shankar and they come back easily for the second. <b>Bangladesh end with 166 with 84 coming off the last 8 overs</b></p>"
19.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mehidy Hasan, 2 runs, uses his feet and drives well, to the right of sweeper cover. They take two</p>"
19.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mehidy Hasan, <b>FOUR</b>, these knuckle balls are going for runs. Right between backward point and short third, Mehidy Hasan threw his bat at that, even though it came off the toe of the bat, importantly for Bangladesh it was in the gap</p>"
19.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mehidy Hasan, no run, had he left that, would've been a wide, but he reaches out to this full and wide delivery, toe end it to Dhawan at backward point, they don't take the single</p>"
19.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mehidy Hasan, <b>SIX</b>, looked high, but Mehidy Hasan had advanced and replays show that it was ok as far as height was concerned. Mehidy Hasan takes it on the full and swings it high and over deep mid. Big hit</p>"
19.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mehidy Hasan, <b>FOUR</b>, the knuckle ball, slower outside off, Mehidy Hasan gets down low, shuffles across and then scoops it over short fine. Did enough to clear the fielder</p>"
18.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Mustafizur, no run, slower delivery to end, Mustafizur pushes it to extra-cover who is at the edge of the ring. India want Mustafizur to be on strike, but they don't take the single. Just 3 runs off the penultimate over! Top bowling by Unadkat</p>"
18.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Mustafizur, no run, crisp drive, with a good bat-flow but again straight to the fielder at mid-off. Good captaincy by Rohit to deny Mehidy Hasan the strike</p>"
18.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Mustafizur, no run, very full now, Mustafizur pushes it to mid-off, Mehidy Hasan wants the strike, but the ball finds the fielder too quickly</p>"
18.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Rubel, <b>out</b> Bowled!! Unadkat is fired up. And how. Cleans up Rubel much like how he did Sabbir. A cutter, came very slow, completely does in Rubel who awkwardly slogs to leg and misses. Game over. <b>Rubel b Unadkat 0(1)</b></p>"
18.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Rubel, <b>wide</b>, too high and way too short, rightly called a wide</p>"
18.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Sabbir Rahman, <b>out</b> Bowled!! Bowled him. Uses the slower delivery to good effect and it goes through Sabbir Rahman's defences. Was too early into the swipe, the ball came much later, falls on the stumps. Massive wicket for Sabbir Rahman was striking it really well. He goes back with the <b>highest score by a Bangladeshi batsman against India in T20Is.</b> <b>Sabbir Rahman b Unadkat 77(50) [4s-7 6s-4]</b></p>"
18.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Sabbir Rahman, 2 runs, <b>Review again by India. For lbw against Sabbir Rahman.</b> Looks like an inside edge onto the pad. The third umpire wants UltraEdge - clear spike and <b>India will lose their review.</b> Sabbir Rahman moved across, to get himself outside the line, the thin snick on the attempted scoop, saved him. Ricochets off the pad and they take two</p>"
17.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, slower one, stands up short, Sabbir Rahman rocks back and pulls to deep mid. Just the single</p>"
17.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, <b>FOUR</b>, now to the other side. Pre-meditated scoop, gets low and takes the fuller one around off, to get it over short fine's head. Lovely batting</p>"
17.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, <b>FOUR</b>, uses the slower delivery and the width on that, it was outside off, so Sabbir Rahman glides it wide of the short third fielder. Showing finesse there</p>"
17.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, no run, <b>Review time.</b> From India. For lbw against Sabbir Rahman. No bat. Is it slipping down? Umpire's call on hitting, so <b>Sabbir Rahman will survive</b> Just clipping and since the onfield ump didn't give it, he survives. Cross-seam delivery in the blockhole, hits the front pad after missing the bat, Sabbir Rahman again was looking for a quick single, was almost halfway down, but <b>SN Thakur missed the under-arm flick. Had that hit, the batsman would've been walking back</b></p>"
17.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mehidy Hasan, 1 run, <b>another chance of a run-out</b>, Sabbir Rahman may have been just in even as Dhawan from backward point missed his throw, Mehidy Hasan had ran a long way forward, so they can't steal another run as the ball is fielded on the dive at deep mid. SN Thakur again isn't happy about something</p>"
17.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, full on the pads, flicked to deep mid-wicket. Mehidy Hasan is happy with just a single</p>"
16.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, slower delivery to end, Sabbir Rahman keeps the strike with a single to sweeper cover</p>"
16.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Shakib, <b>out</b> Shakib Run Out!! They take on Rahul and the tag-team of KL Rahul and Vijay Shankar do an exceptional job to get Shakib. Driven to extra-cover, straight to the fielder, KL fires in an awkward throw on the bounce to Vijay Shankar who manages to parry the ball onto the stumps. Shakib was just short. He didn't dive either. Had he done so, would've survived. But credit to the bowler for handling such a fast throw near his feet. <b>Shakib run out (KL/Vijay Shankar) 7(7) [4s-1]</b></p>"
16.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, <b>thank Masuri and other companies who manufacture helmets.</b> Sabbir Rahman should thank them, because if there was no grille, it would've smashed into his face and broken a few teeth. Another full-toss, he attempts the cheeky ramp scoop and edges it onto the grille, the helmet takes the brunt of the blow even as Sabbir Rahman's head is pushed back by the impact. The ricochet goes near mid-wicket</p>"
16.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, <b>SIX</b>, back-of-the-hand slower delivery gone horribly wrong. Ends up being a juicy full-toss, Sabbir Rahman smashed that over deep mid's head. Just over even as the fielder tried to leap and catch that. Sails over him</p>"
16.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, no run, Vijay Shankar comes back well. Right into the blockhole, dug out back to the bowler</p>"
16.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, <b>SIX</b>, Sabbir Rahman is teeing off now. One too many slower balls. Sabbir Rahman waits on the crease and sits down to slog it over cow-corner. Got enough bat to get it all the way</p>"
15.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, too full on the stumps, Sabbir Rahman drives to long-on to keep the strike</p>"
15.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Shakib, 1 run, slower and on the pads, worked through mid-wicket</p>"
15.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Shakib, no run, slower and following Shakib, as he made room to cut, it hurried on and spoilt his timing, chopped to backward point</p>"
15.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, <b>50 for Sabbir Rahman</b>. Got there with a drive to long-off after using his feet. He needs to kick on though and be there till the end</p>"
15.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, <b>SIX</b>, fine shot. Saw the slower tossed up delivery outside off and heaved it with all his might. Got hold of the shot too and it sails over deep mid. Much-needed six</p>"
15.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Shakib, 1 run, slower, drifting into the pads, whipped off the back foot to leg</p>"
14.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Shakib, 1 run, angled in on a good length on off, Shakib defends in front of backward point, easy run</p>"
14.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Shakib, no run, goes under the bat of Shakib who was trying to cut that, may have kept a shade low to beat the bottom edge</p>"
14.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Shakib, <b>FOUR</b>, edged and four. Shakib flashes at a full ball outside off, with no slip, the edge was always going away, third man is too square to get across. Raced off the bat and well wide of DK</p>"
14.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, another slower delivery, on the stumps, pushed to mid-off</p>"
14.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, <b>out</b> Mahmudullah Run Out!! Serious brainblast from both batsmen especially Sabbir Rahman. Mahmudullah was concerned about the lbw call, because it was close, totally done in by the slower delivery, trying to work to leg and missed. Off the pad to DK, Sabbir Rahman though wanted the strike and was at the other end. DK threw it back to Vijay Shankar who was sliding, scrambling but manages to get to the stumps to run Mahmudullah out. Totally Sabbir Rahman's fault. Mahmudullah sacrificed his wicket, initially thought to stay his ground, but seeing Vijay Shankar's awkwardly body movements, may have felt a tiny chance to escape. He didn't and Bangladesh have lost a wicket at the wrong time. And the big one of Mahmudullah too. <b>Mahmudullah run out (Karthik/Vijay Shankar) 21(16) [4s-2]</b></p>"
14.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, <b>FOUR</b>, poor bowling. With short fine inside the ring, full and on the pads, Mahmudullah flicks wide of short fine and deep square is too far away from the ball to get across</p>"
13.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mahmudullah, 1 run, full-toss, may have been another knuckle ball attempted, tapped down to long-on</p>"
13.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Mahmudullah, no run, now the cross-seamer, on a fuller length and this swung away to beat the drive of Mahmudullah, close to taking the snick. DK liked that and well bowled. Using all his variations</p>"
13.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, another knuckle ball, Sabbir Rahman taps it through cover and takes the single on offer</p>"
13.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, no run, beautiful knuckle ball and it swung from the hand, and in the air, Sabbir Rahman wanted to run it down wide of DK, could only get a feather, not good enough to beat the keeper</p>"
13.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, <b>FOUR</b>, Sabbir Rahman goes straight over SN Thakur now. Consecutive fours. Uses his feet and thumps the length delivery straight. Long-off and long-on can't get to the ball</p>"
13.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, <b>FOUR</b>, first bit of bad fielding in the field and it comes from Chahal. SN Thakur and Rohit aren't happy. Chahal at short fine, was slow to dive and when he did, allowed the ball to slip under his fingers, got up and chased it, as did DK and one more fielder, but the trio weren't able to cut the boundary</p>"
12.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, slower delivery on off, Sabbir Rahman defends with soft hands, in front of cover, easy run</p>"
12.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Mahmudullah, 1 run, <b>had Unadkat hit, Mahmudullah was gone.</b> Unadkat covering ground to his right on his followthrough, was quick to get across, picked it up with his right-hand and then transferred it to his left, before firing a throw, it missed and the diving Mahmudullah scraped home. But what backing up by Rohit at extra cover, the ball was speeding across the turf, he slid to his right and came up with the cherry in one hand - before hurling a throw to DK. Top quality fielding - shows how intense India are tonight. The captain setting the example</p>"
12.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Mahmudullah, <b>FOUR</b>, beautiful shot. Third man was inside the ring, on a back of a length outside off, width there to play the late glide, Mahmudullah opens the face of the bat and gets it right between backward point and short third. Lovely batting</p>"
12.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Mahmudullah, no run, off-cutter, slowed down the pace, tricked Mahmudullah completely, defended back to Unadkat</p>"
12.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, short of length angling in, towards off and middle, nudged to the left of short fine leg</p>"
12.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Mahmudullah, 1 run, angled in from round the wicket, on a good length, dabbed down to third man</p>"
11.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, 1 run, short delivery on off, pulled to the right of Manish Pandey who almost overruns it but reads the spin on that and comes up with the ball. He must be the best in this lot, isn't he?</p>"
11.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, slower delivery, Sabbir Rahman uses his feet and can't get hold of the big hit, slugged to deep mid</p>"
11.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, 1 run, too straight, nudged to short fine leg, easy run taken</p>"
11.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, the slower delivery, on the pads, gently worked in front of long-on, even Raina isn't able to prevent the quick two this time</p>"
11.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, <b>wide</b>, down leg</p>"
11.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, Raina has put on some weight, I can see that but still is a top fielder. He sprints to his right from long-on and then puts in the dive to come up with the ball with his right-hand when he got up, saved two. Super effort from the senior man after running across</p>"
11.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, Mahmudullah comes down the track and is lucky that he didn't time the slog, if he had got it off the middle of the bat, would've found deep mid, it bounces well wide of the fielder</p>"
10.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Mahmudullah, 1 run, slower and width outside off, Mahmudullah reaches out and cuts to sweeper cover to keep the strike</p>"
10.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Mahmudullah, no run, lovely. Lovely. Variation. From Chahal, the flipper, zoots off the track, Mahmudullah defends off the back foot</p>"
10.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, takes it from outside off and swipes along the ground to deep mid</p>"
10.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Mahmudullah, 1 run, nearly through Mahmudullah's defences. Beautifully bowled googly, on a fuller length, Mahmudullah has trouble against the wrong'uns, he pushes at the ball with a gap between bat and pad. Thick inside edge saves him</p>"
10.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, shortish, Sabbir Rahman goes back and pulls hard, on the bounce to deep mid</p>"
10.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Rahim, <b>out</b> Caught by Vijay Shankar!! Rahim goes now. He was itching to go after Chahal, does so but perishes. Another well-held catch by the Indians in the field. But it is Chahal's wicket. Slowed it down, made Rahim reach out for it as he advanced, the left leg's balance was shot with the weight not going into the attempted carve, skied to the right of backward point where Vijay Shankar covers good ground to take a tumbling catch. Replays shows that it was the attempted googly. <b>Rahim c Vijay Shankar b Chahal 9(12)</b></p>"
9.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, no run, superb bowling. This kid is a serious talent. Rams in the yorker, on seeing Sabbir Rahman advance, the batsman can only dig it out. Would've seen Rahman advance previously, so knew what he was doing there</p>"
9.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Rahim, 1 run, full and wristed to long-on</p>"
9.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Rahim, no run, fired in full, Rahim squeezes it out straight to the fielder at cover</p>"
9.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, was that the slower overspinner? Could well have been, Sabbir Rahman had to wait for an age for the ball to arrive, when it does, he can only get a tiny part of the bat on the reverse sweep which is good enough to give him only a single</p>"
9.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, 2 runs, down the track again, takes it on the full, didn't get hold of it, but wide of the fielder in the deep for two more</p>"
9.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Rahim, 1 run, superbly bowled. Not sure whether he saw Rahim charging or he decided to bowl what he did, Rahim who is down the wicket, sees the length short and the ball spinning, dabs to the off-side for a single</p>"
8.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Rahim, 1 run, flat trajectory, pushed through on off, Rahim was making room to go over cover, had to adjust and dabbed it wide of backward point in the end to get the single</p>"
8.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, back to slowing it down, tossed up outside off, Sabbir Rahman fetches the sweep from there and finds deep mid</p>"
8.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, no run, quicker one now and raps Sabbir Rahman on the pad, but it was sliding down, Sabbir Rahman was beaten for pace as he tried to flick, rushed through - the attempted flipper</p>"
8.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, no run, slower and outside off, fullish length, Sabbir Rahman steers it straight to the fielder at backward point</p>"
8.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Rahim, 1 run, Vijay Shankar does well and Rohit applauds that effort by clapping. Swept wide of him at short fine and he slides across to pick the ball up with one hand, keeps it to a single</p>"
8.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, tossed up slower and outside off, making Sabbir Rahman reach out for the drive, through cover and wide of the fielder</p>"
7.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, unnecessary from Dhawan at short third. The batsmen had decided against the quick single, but he hits direct and the ricochet slips away from Vijay Shankar's grasp who was backing up. Gives the run to Sabbir Rahman</p>"
7.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Rahim, 1 run, now Rahim charges Vijay Shankar, with the bowler following the batsman, swiped straight to the fielder on the bounce to deep mid</p>"
7.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, very full outside off, dug out wide of the diving Vijay Shankar</p>"
7.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, <b>FOUR</b>, clever and cheeky from Sabbir Rahman. Full around off, he just bends his head down a tad and then uses the bat as a broom, paddling it over the fielder. 10 off 2 and suddenly there's some momentum being injected</p>"
7.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Sabbir Rahman, <b>SIX</b>, good hit. Maybe they have seen what Vijay Shankar bowls, which is hitting the pitch hard on a back of a length, so Sabbir Rahman walks down the track and then thumps the pull flat to the deep backward square fence. There was a fielder at deep square, but this was placed well wide of him</p>"
7.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Vijay Shankar to Rahim, 1 run, full outside off, Rahim wrists an on-drive to long-on</p>"
6.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Rahim, 1 run, pushed through flat outside off, Rahim dabs wide of backward point, Sabbir Rahman races across to complete the single</p>"
6.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, drags the length back, but keeps it slower and on a flat trajectory, Sabbir Rahman waits for it and then controls the pull to send it to deep mid-wicket</p>"
6.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Rahim, 1 run, tried the topspinner, went full and straight outside off, Rahim sweeps it along the ground to deep mid</p>"
6.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, shortish and that allows Sabbir Rahman to go back and cut that to sweeper cover</p>"
6.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, no run, good reverse sweep, but straight to the fielder at backward point. Unadkat makes a good stop</p>"
6.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Rahim, 1 run, tossed up outside off, steered in front of backward point, easy single taken</p>"
5.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, no run, Thakur is the one who is frantically appealing for lbw, even when DK tells him that there's bat involved. Low swinging full-toss, drifting down, Sabbir Rahman shuffles across and there's a tickle to DK, who catches it on the bounce and indicates to the bowler who still is appealing. Rohit comes across and <b>finally they don't take the review</b></p>"
5.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, <b>wide</b>, fires it outside the tramline way outside off, called a wide</p>"
5.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, no run, another cross-seam short delivery, hurries onto Sabbir Rahman who mistimes the pull to mid-wicket</p>"
5.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, <b>FOUR</b>, top edge and over DK's head. Cross-seamer from SN Thakur, on a short of length, pacy, but Sabbir Rahman pulls and gets lucky</p>"
5.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, no run, short of length on middle, tucked to the right of mid-wicket. There was an easy single on offer, but confusion between the two batsmen, eventually they don't go for it with Sabbir Rahman sent back</p>"
5.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Rahim, leg byes, 1 run, sliding down, raps the pad, but never going to get that, so SN Thakur's appeal is academic. They take a legbye</p>"
5.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">SN Thakur to Sabbir Rahman, 1 run, Sabbir Rahman wants to keep attacking. He charges at SN Thakur, swipes the length ball off the inside half of the bat to deep square</p>"
4.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Soumya Sarkar, <b>out</b> Caught by Dhawan!! Another one for Chahal. Bangladesh are falling apart here. The sweep doing the damage for Soumya Sarkar. Was there to be put away, sliding down, but Sarkar hit it straight to the fielder at backward square, just beside the umpire. Hit with power but no placement. Dhawan did well to grasp that as it was travelling. When it is not going your way, this happens. Two for Chahal in the over. <b>Soumya Sarkar c Dhawan b Chahal 1(2)</b></p>"
4.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, leg byes, 1 run, down leg, off the pad and going down</p>"
4.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Sabbir Rahman, <b>FOUR</b>, dangerous shot, but Sabbir Rahman has hit that well. Full on middle, swept hard and flat over mid-wicket's head. Good blow</p>"
4.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, Chahal dived across but couldn't stop that crisp drive to his left. Soumya Sarkar gets off the mark with a single</p>"
4.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Tamim, <b>out</b> Caught by SN Thakur!! Take a bow Shardul. What a catch under pressure and with a moonball to boot. Tamim holes out. All smiles in the Indian camp as they rush towards the pacer to congratulate him. Tamim used his feet and even though he didn't get to the pitch of that one, decided to loft, went a mile up in the air, towards long-on. Thakur was positioned inches inside the cushions, reverse-cups it and manages to hold his left leg's momentum, arrested and stopped the foot there even as he balanced his weight on the other leg. Then when the ball and body was totally in control, ran forward to celebrate. He could've thrown it up, gone out, come in and taken it. But trusted his instincts and strength to not do that. Superb effort and Bangladesh have lost both the openers. <b>Tamim c SN Thakur b Chahal 15(13) [4s-1]</b></p>"
4.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Chahal to Tamim, no run, on the pads, Tamim sweeps and finds Dhawan at backward square. Chahal lucky that it went straight to the fielder, either side of the fielder and it was four</p>"
3.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, no run, very full, Sabbir Rahman could've driven that if he wanted or gone over cover, instead he opts to defend this to cover</p>"
3.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, no run, flat and angled in on off and middle, nudged to mid-wicket</p>"
3.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, no run, superb bowling. Sabbir Rahman is beaten playing for the turn. This is bowled on a good length and it skids after pitching, since the batsman was playing for the turn, it held its line and beat the outside edge. Top class stuff from the youngster</p>"
3.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Sabbir Rahman, no run, first ball and what does Sabbir Rahman do? Pre-meditation again, went for the reverse sweep, bit of glove and bat, it rolls to backward point. No chance of a quick single</p>"
3.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Liton Das, <b>out</b> Caught by Raina!! That's the first blow. Well bowled by Washington Sundar, slowed it up and flighted it up above the batsman's eyeline, the length was full but Liton Das had pre-meditated his sweep even before he saw the ball, shuffled across to get it over square leg, top edge straight up and Raina cups a dolly near short fine. <b>Liton Das c Raina b Washington Sundar 11(9) [6s-1]</b></p>"
3.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Tamim, 1 run, sliding down and a gentle tickle off the pads, short fine is Unadkat, they take him on and complete an easy single</p>"
2.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Tamim, 1 run, another cutter, the offie variety, on a length on off, Tamim calmly keeps the strike with a single to deep square</p>"
2.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Liton Das, 1 run, shuffles across expecting to work it across the line, a slower delivery around off, he does hit the gap with a turn of the wrists</p>"
2.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Tamim, 1 run, over the wicket now to Tamim, angles a good length delivery on middle, turned to mid-wicket who is deep and it's an easy single</p>"
2.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Liton Das, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Liton Das push-drives to the right of mid-off</p>"
2.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Liton Das, <b>SIX</b>, the first biggie of the game. Liton Das charges Unadkat and since the ball was angled across him, he opened his arms and carved it over sweeper cover, the ball lands beyond the boundary ropes. Opened the bat face at the last moment and got the elevation to get the ball to go all the way</p>"
2.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Tamim, 3 runs, brilliant fielding by Manish Pandey. Running to his right from deep square leg, he dives to his right after that sprint and pushes the ball back. Saves a run for his side. Every run counts in this format</p>"
1.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Liton Das, no run, nicely tossed up, Liton Das watchfully pushes it back to Washington Sundar. Another good first over from the youngster</p>"
1.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Tamim, 1 run, very full on the pads, flicked to deep mid-wicket, for a single</p>"
1.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Tamim, 2 runs, slowed it up, shorter, Tamim rocks back and pulls it to the right of deep mid for a couple</p>"
1.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Tamim, no run, DK and slip went up for a big appeal asking for LBW, but Washington Sundar isn't keen. Angling in, rushing through and hitting the front pad above the kneeroll. Missed the forward defence. <b>Would've been going down.</b> India rightly don't take the review</p>"
1.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Tamim, no run, very full, hint of drift in, Tamim pushes it to the left of Washington Sundar. That came off the inside half of the bat</p>"
1.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Washington Sundar to Liton Das, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Liton Das gets forward and pushes it to long-on to get a single</p>"
0.6,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Tamim, <b>FOUR</b>, good batting. Intelligent stuff from Tamim. He knows that short fine is inside the ring and anything over and wide of him will fetch him a boundary. So gets inside the line of this short of length delivery on the hips and flamingo-flicks over the man's head. Spoils the over for Unadkat</p>"
0.5,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Liton Das, 1 run, on a length and around off, Liton Das turns the wrists on the ball and sends it to the vacant square leg region</p>"
0.4,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Tamim, 1 run, short of length on middle, whipped straight to the fielder at deep square leg</p>"
0.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Liton Das, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabbed down to third man to get himself off the mark</p>"
0.3,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Liton Das, <b>wide</b>, slips it down leg. Radar went astray there</p>"
0.2,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Liton Das, no run, fullish outside off, Liton Das tentatively pushes it down the track, the ball rolls to the left of Unadkat</p>"
0.1,"<p class=""cb-col cb-col-90 cb-com-ln"">Unadkat to Tamim, 1 run, hint of swing in the air for Unadkat, curved in the air and Tamim is off the mark with a tapped single wide of mid-on</p>"
